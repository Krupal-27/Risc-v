# Risc-v
This repository contains a complete implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU core that executes the RV32I base integer instruction set. The project was designed in Verilog/SystemVerilog to demonstrate fundamental computer architecture concepts, including instruction pipelining, data hazards, and control flow.
